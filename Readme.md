📌 Future Project Plan

This backend will be converted into a full To-Do List application in the next stage of development.
The final project will use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and will include:

A modern React frontend for managing tasks

User authentication (Login & Signup)

Create, edit, delete, and complete tasks

Task filtering (All / Completed / Pending)

A clean and responsive UI

Secure API integration with this backend

This backend serves as the foundation for the complete To-Do List app that will be built later.
